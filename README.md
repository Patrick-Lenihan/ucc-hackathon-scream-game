# ucc-hackathon-scream-game
## synopsis
Todays aplications profess to be imersive but rarely use most of your senses.
Enter the scream game, a set of games designed to be controled by voice and volume.

Picture this instead of the silent gaming experience at the bus stop, imagine a world where a concofany of noise let you know that the poeple are enjoying their gaming experiece.

Think of the increased lung capacity we could acheive as a population if instead of spending time with video games we spent time instead on increasing the volume of or voices. 

We don't want to brag but if we allow people to better hear each other we can probably at least acheive world peace in the 12 hours we have in this hachathon.
