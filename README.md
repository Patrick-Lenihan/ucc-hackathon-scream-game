# ucc-hackathon-scream-game
## synopsis
Today's applications profess to be immersive but rarely use most of your senses.
Enter the scream game, a set of games designed to be controlled by voice and volume.

Picture this: instead of the silent gaming experience at the bus stop, imagine a world where a cacophony of noise let you know that the people are enjoying their gaming experience.

Think of the increased lung capacity we could achieve as a population if instead of spending time with video games we spent time instead on increasing the volume of our voices. 

We don't want to brag but if we allow people to better hear each other we can probably at least achieve world peace in the 12 hours we have in this hackathon.

## responsibilities 
Ben - in charge of scream controlled sidescroller game
Zhi - in charge of the max scream jumping game
Patrick: in charge of the volume and speech recognition and integration.
